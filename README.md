# Cloud-Migrator Data Manager

Data Manager is a tool designed to validate data migration technologies by setting up a testing environment and generating the necessary test data for migration.

It provides the following key features:

1. Creates data storage (either storage or database) in the source and target computing environments.
2. Generates and stores test data in the created source data storage.
3. Performs data replication/migration from the source to the target computing environment, including data pre/post-processing operations during the transfer.
